    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "Here I will provide a basic introduction to Python 3.5+. We will review the variable types in Python and some basic functionalities. For learning more about Python, I recommend finding other tutorials. The main purpose of this tutorial is to provide a brief introduction to Python and serve as a refresher for basic functionalities. There are much better introductions than mine. My efforts in these tutorials primarly focus on conducting epidemiology analyses, which are downstream of basic Python functionalities (although necessary). \n",

First, you set up the ``if`` statement. If we want see whether two numbers are equal, we use ``a == b``. The ``if`` line then ends with a colon.

    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions are series of operations that can be linked together in one chunk of code. It makes it easy to run a calcuation multiple times or with different numbers. Every library uses functions (or classes) to allow you to perform operations. In this example, we will go over how to create your own function to use in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we will create a function to calculate the risk ratio. The first line begins with 'def' which stands for define. next we provide a function name. We call ours 'risk_ratio'. Next are the paratheses containing the input variables. Our function has four required variables. The inputs designated `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Without them, our function will produce an error. Note that everything below is indented. This tells Python what is included in a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next part of the function is documentation. This is to help us remember what this function is used for. When writing this section, be as detailed as possible. How would you improve the documentation? We can view the functions documentation by running help(risk_ratio). This is helpful when trying to see what argument options are available for a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have a series of statements that our function executes when called. Our function only calculates the risk ratio if all inputs are postive numbers (or zero). We also use `return`, which returns the value calculated. So if we set `x = risk_ratio(...)`, `x` will be set equal to `rr` from our function.\n",
