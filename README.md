# Python-for-Epidemiologists
This is a guided tutorial for epidemiologists who are interested in using Python 3.x as a software for data cleaning/analysis. This tutorial is meant to provide the basics of coding in Python.

In this tutorial, we will discuss: 
    1) Basics of Python 
    2) Data manipulation basics
    3) Epidemiology analysis tools
    4) Basic graphic creation

Files included:
    tutorial.py     - Python code used for the basic introduction tutorial
    graphics.py     - Python code for matplotlib generated graphics
    data.csv        - sample dataset that will be used for tutorial analyses
    python_basic.md - Basic tutorial for Python

## Installing Python

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
This can be chosen later. I prefer to use Rodeo from Y-Hat, but any IDE will work. Basically what works/looks the best for you is what you should use. Some general options: Rodeo, Spyder, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook (more in depth discussion here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-python-ide)

### Python Packages
Packages are what stores Python functions that we will use. These packages are contributed by various members of the community and there is a wide array. 
#### Recommended packages
Packages that are required to complete this tutorial: NumPy, Pandas, NetworkX, zEpid, matplotlib, statsmodels
Other recommended packages: seaborn, biopython
