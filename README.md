# Python-for-Epidemiologists
This is a guided tutorial for epidemiologists who are interested in using Python 3.x as a software for data cleaning/analysis. This tutorial is meant to provide the basics of coding in Python.

In this tutorial, we will discuss: 
    1) Installing Python
    2) Basics of Python 
    3) Data manipulation basics
    4) Epidemiology analysis tools
    5) Basic graphic creation

Files included:
    tutorial.py - Python code used for the basic introduction tutorial
    graphics.py - Python code for matplotlib generated graphics
    data.csv    - sample dataset that will be used for tutorial analyses

## Installing Python

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
This can be chosen later. I prefer to use Rodeo from Y-Hat, but any IDE will work. Basically what works/looks the best for you is what you should use. Some general options: Rodeo, Spyder, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook (more in depth discussion here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-python-ide)

### Python Packages
Packages are what stores Python functions that we will use. These packages are contributed by various members of the community and there is a wide array. 

Packages that are required to complete this tutorial are: NumPy, Pandas, ...

## Python Basics
Note that in Python everything after # in Python is designated as a comment
```python
#Everything afterwards is considered a comment
```

### Object Types
Now that you have Python installed and chosen your IDE, let's discuss the basic object types in Python. There are a plethora of object types in Python. We will discuss the basic object types here.
#### Basic Data Types
Below are some of the most common data types that you will see in Python. These are the fundamental building blocks of every higher level item. Note that print() is a basic function that prints the results & type() is a basic function that determines the type of object that is designated
1) Integer (numbers with no decimals)
```python
x = 2
print(type(x))
```
The above print() statement should produce the following output
```
<class 'int'>
```

2) Float (numbers with decimals)

3) Boolean (True / False objects)
