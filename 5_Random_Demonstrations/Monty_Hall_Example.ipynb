    "# Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem is a fun probability problem that can be counterintuitive. Pulling from Parade 1990 (vos Savant, Marilyn (9 September 1990). \"Ask Marilyn\". Parade Magazine: 16.) the problem is phrased as:\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to always switch your choice. You probability of winning goes from 1/3 to 2/3. There has been a variety of mathematical proofs and other demonstrations of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to reduce the counterintuitiveness of this answer. For example, Paul Erdos (a famous mathematician) was unconvinced until he say computer simulations demonstrating this. I wrote this program as a simple way to mess around with the problem and explore how switching your choice is always preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original problem is interesting itself, the real fun demonstrations start when you explore more door options. Specifically, a scenario with 5 options is interesting. You can adapt my code to various other scenarios (10 doors / 20 doors / etc.). There are two options to set options and trials. trials controls the number of simulations to run. It is recommended to keep this as a high number. As a default, I have trials=100000."
