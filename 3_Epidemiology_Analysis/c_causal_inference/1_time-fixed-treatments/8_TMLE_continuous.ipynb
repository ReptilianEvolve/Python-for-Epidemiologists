    "# Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n",
    "The targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) is a doubly robust estimator. What distinguishes it from other doubly robust estimators (augmented-IPTW) is that it uses a secondary targeting (hence the name) step that optimizes the bias-variance tradeoff for the target parameter. A common target parameter is the sample average treatment effect, which compares to counterfactual where all individuals in the study sample were treated versus the counterfactual where no individual was treated. Throughout this section, I will use the notation that is common in the TMLE literature. This is a little different from the notation in other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target parameter is defined as\n",
    "$$\\psi = E_L\\left[E\\left[Y^{a=1}|L\\right] - E\\left[Y^{a=0}|L\\right]\\right]$$\n",
    "For continuous outcomes, this is the only parameter provided\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on estimating TMLE with a continuous outcome. Behind the scenes, TMLE converts the outcome to be bounded between 0 and 1. This allows TMLE to be correctly estimated. This bounding will not impact the user results since `TMLE` bounds the outcome data and unbounds the results, $\\psi$. Unlike binary outcomes, `TMLE` only provides the averge treatment effect, as defined above. I will demonstrate with both the default regression models and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also build on the previous tutorial and account for missing at random data using IPMW\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Outcomes\n",
    "To motivate our example, we will use a simulated data set included with *zEpid*. In the data set, we have a cohort of HIV-positive individuals. We are interested in the sample average treatment effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on CD4 T-cell count at 45 weeks. We will ignore competing risks for this example demonstration. Based on substantive background knowledge, we believe that the treated and untreated population are exchangeable based gender, age, CD4 T-cell count, and detectable viral load. \n",
    "\n",
    "If no custom model is specified, users can request either Normal or Poisson distributions for continuous outcomes. We will first demonstrate with an assumed normal distribution for the outcome model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TMLE` detects whether the outcome is continuous in the background, so you don't have to specify anything special for continuous outcome data"
