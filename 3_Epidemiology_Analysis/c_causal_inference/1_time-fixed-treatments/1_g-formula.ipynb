    "# Parametric g-formula\n",
    "The g-formula is a general equation to obtain the marginal causal effect of a treatment plan. Similar to the other estimators, we assume exchangeability, positivity, and causal consistency. Additionally, if we use the parametric g-formula, we assume that our model is correctly specified. The g-formula has always fascinated me and I believe is the fundamental method for causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial details how to use the g-formula to estimate risks under a fixed regime for a single time point. To estimate the marginal risk, we will predict the outcomes under different treatment plans. For a more detailed introduction, please refer to the listed references.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I will provide some intuition on how the g-formula works. There are two basic views of the g-formula that we can adopt; the standardization view versus the imputation view\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardization\n",
    "Under the identifiability assumptions, the g-formula allows us to identify the marginal value of the potential outcome ($Y^a$) for the outcome $Y$ under treatment $A=a$. Below is the derivation\n",
    "$$E[Y^a] = \\sum_l E[Y^a|L=l] \\Pr(L=l)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\sum_l E[Y^a|A=a, L=l] \\Pr(L=l)$$\n",
    "$$ = \\sum_l E[Y|A=aL=l] \\Pr(L=l)$$\n",
    "where the first step uses the law of total probability, the next uses conditional exchangeability ($Y^a \\amalg A|L$), and the last uses causal consistency ($Y = Y^{a=1}\\times A + Y^{a=0} \\times (1-A)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, we are able to identify the average potential outcome $Y^a$ using only the observed. This is huge progress! If you look at the above formula long enough, you will notice that the g-formula is just the standardized mean. So, this is our first viewpoint of the g-formula\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imputation\n",
    "Alternatively, we can view the g-formula as an imputation procedure. Under causal consistency, we see that we only observed one of the potential outcomes. With this view, the g-formula becomes a way we can impute the missing outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## g-computation procedure\n",
    "Now that we have some intuition, what is happening behind the scenes? When $A$ and $L$ are binary, it is trivial to solve the g-formula. However, it becomes difficult to solve with many confounders (like most scenarios). The way we can get around this difficult is using parametric regression models, referred to as the g-computation algorithm in the literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit a regression model for the outcome as a function of the exposure and confounding variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Predict outcomes $\\widehat{Y_i^a}$ under the treatment plan of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take the mean of the predicted outcomes to get $E[Y^a]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is all done by `TimeFixedGFormula`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Applied Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Outcome\n",
    "In the following example, use a simulated data set that comes with zEpid. For our example, we are interested in the 45-week risk of death under several different treatment strategies. Specifically, our cohort is of HIV-infected individuals and we are interested in different anti-retroviral treatment (ART) strategies. First we will load the data set and create spline terms for age and CD4"

I demonstrated obtaining confidence intervals through a bootstrap procedure. Lastly, I showed how to specify custom treatment plans.
